# Before you start

![](img/various/console_vs_orchestrator.png)

Read this document from the beginning to the end once, then read it again before you decide to get your hands dirty.

You might have a feeling of "d√©j√† vu" as it is essentially a scrambled from various sources including [nixOS](https://nixos.org) and [nixOS manual](https://nixos.org/manual/nixos/stable/index.html), [nixOS Wiki](https://nixos.wiki/wiki/Main_Page), [nix-bitcoin](https://nixbitcoin.org/), [Virtual Box](https://www.virtualbox.org/), [raspibolt](https://raspibolt.org/) and [Raspiblitz](https://github.com/rootzoll/raspiblitz#readme) (although the approach of MY‚ÇøONK is radically different).

If you have any experience with the command line or already run any other full node you have a significant advantage, you could complete this setup in 2 hours maybe, otherwize allocate 1 day.

We [collaboratively] take great pride and care maintaining this document so it remains up to date and concise, often it refers to external links. Explore these external links when instructed to, this will make the journey smoother.

It is assumed that you know a little bit of everything but not enough so we show you the way step by step based on the typical MY‚ÇøONK setup.
You too can contribute to impriving this document on GitHub.

Enjoy the ride, no stress, check out our [FAQ](/docs/faq.md) and our [baby rabbit holes](/docs/baby-rabbit-holes.md)  :hole: :rabbit2:


### Overview
This example small ecosystem consists of only two elements that we are going to build together:


- **One MY‚ÇøONK orchestrator:**
  This machine is used to orchestrate your fleet of MY‚ÇøONK consoles, it is essentially a Linux with a few additional software installed including the Nix package manager.
- **One MY‚ÇøONK console:**
  This machine runs the [MY‚ÇøONK stack](/docs/MYBONK_stack.md) on NixOS. It is setup once and its configuration can be updated remotly using MY‚ÇøONK orchestrator.

### Terminology
- '````#````' stands for '````$ sudo````'
- **MY‚ÇøONK core**: Or simply 'MY‚ÇøONK' is a tailor-made full-node [software stack](/docs/MYBONK_stack.md) for MY‚ÇøONK console (although it can run on pretty much any hardware if you are ready to tune and hack a little bit). MY‚ÇøONK core is based on nix-bitcoin itself based on nixOS.
- **MY‚ÇøONK console**: A full-node bitcoin-only hardware platform designed with anonymity, security, low price, performance, durability, low-enery, supply chain resilience and generic parts in mind.
- **MY‚ÇøONK user**: The end user, you, the family man, the boucher, the baker, the hair dresser, the mecanics... Just want the thing to work, "plug and forget". Uses very simple user interface and never uses the command line. On MAINNET.
- **MY‚ÇøONK operator**: A "MY‚ÇøONK user" that got really serious about it and decided to learn more, move to the next level. Has some "skin in the game" on MAINNET and is happy to experiment on SIGNET. Many operators take part in nodes Federations or create their own Federation.
- **MY‚ÇøONK hacker**: A "MY‚ÇøONK operator" so deep in the rabbit hole, bitcoin, privacy and sovereignty that he became a MY‚ÇøONK hacker. That's an advanced user, student, Maker, researcher, security expert .etc... Just want to tear things apart. Love to use command line. On SIGNET.

### Advice
- **Don't trust, verify**: Anything you download on the internet is at risk of being malicious software. Know your sources. Always run the GPG (signature) or SHA-256 (hash) verification (typically next to the download link of an image or package there is a sting of hexadecimal characters).
- **Nix vs. NixOS**: It is very important to understand the concept that nix and nixOS are two different things:
  - Nix is a [package manager](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Package_manager) (something like npm, rpm and others)
  - NixOS is a [full-blow Linux distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NixOS) built on top of the nix package manager. For an overview see [how Nix and NixOS work](https://nixos.org/guides/how-nix-works.html).
  - For a general introduction to the Nix and NixOS ecosystem, see [nix.dev](https://nix.dev/).
- **Read and explore**: The pros write and read documentation, they are not so much on YouTube.

### ssh and auto login

This is so important that we felt it diserved its own section.

![](img/various/ssh_failed_attempts.gif)


Spare yourself the pain, learn good habbits and avoid getting locked out of your system by mistake. Take the time to not only understand what ssh is but also how it works, particularily how to use ssh auto login (auto login *using public and private keys pair* to be specific). It is not only a good idea to save time, it is also significantly more secure than simple password-based login. It is also a pre-requisite for the deployment of MY‚ÇøONK, have a look at the [baby rabbit holes](/docs/baby-rabbit-holes.md#ssh) section about ssh üï≥ üêá

# 1. Build your MYBONK bitcoin full node

  There are many ways to do this, the one detailed here focuses on people with little (but still *some*) technical knowledge.

  These steps can be automated but the goal now is for you to *understand* hot it works.

### 1.1 The hardware

There are many many platforms, physical (HW) or virtual (Virtual Machines, Cloud) to choose from, which is what NixOS was made for in the first place and this is great. A collection of hardware specific platform profiles to optimize settings for different hardware is even being maintained at [NixOS Hardware repository](https://github.com/NixOS/nixos-hardware/blob/master/README.md).


The following steps focus on MY‚ÇøONK console hardware platform only because it would be impossible to maintain and support all the possible combinations for a specific application domain: Each hardware has its own specs, some have additional features (BIOS capabilities, onboard encrypton, various kinds of storages and partition systems .etc...) or limitations (too little RAM or unreliable parts, weak power source, "moving parts", cooling issues, higher power consumption .etc...) making it unadvisable to install onto, or too difficult for an average user to setup and maintain; Even little things like bootable or not from USB stick can turn what should be a beautiful journey into hours of frustration tring to just make the thing boot until the next pitfall.

MY‚ÇøONK console is a full-node bitcoin-only hardware platform designed with anonymity, security, low price, performance, durability, low-enery, supply chain resilience and generic parts in mind. You too can get a MY‚ÇøONK console, just join our [Telegram group](https://t.me/+_uAJ02x5g_VhYjQ0).



MY‚ÇøONK console can also be used to run Raspiblitz similarly to Raspberry pi or other distributions.

### 1.2 Download and install NixOS

  Now we are taking you through the standard steps of installing nixOS on MY‚ÇøONK console.

  A NixOS live CD image can be downloaded from the [NixOS download page](https://nixos.org/download.html#nixos-iso) to install from (make sure you scroll down to the bottom of the page as the first half of it is about nix *package manager* not nixOS).

  Download the "*Graphical* ISO image", it is bigger than the "Minimal ISO image" but it will give you a good first experience using nixOS and will ease some configuration steps like setting up default keyboard layout and disk partitionning which are typical pain points for "not-so-experienced-users". NixOS' new installation wizard in the Graphical ISO image makes it so much more user-friendly.

  Flash the iso image on a USB stick using [balenaEtcher](https://www.balena.io/etcher/).

  Plug your MY‚ÇøONK console to the power source and to your network switch using an RJ45 cable.

  Plug the keyboard and the screen, they are used only during this first guided installation procedure, after this all interactions with the MY‚ÇøONK console will be done "headless" via the MY‚ÇøONK orchestrator as explained in section [Control your MY‚ÇøONK fleet from MY‚ÇøONK orchestrator](#3-basic-operations).



  Stick on USB stick in your MY‚ÇøONK console

  Turn on MY‚ÇøONK console, keep pressing ESC on the keyboard during boot to access the BIOS settings.

  ![](img/NixOS_install_screenshots/NixOS_install_screenshot_005.png)


  Make sure the following settings are set:

-  ``Boot mode select`` set to ``[Legacy]``
-  ``Boot Option #1`` set to ``USB Device: [USB]``

  ![](img/NixOS_install_screenshots/NixOS_install_screenshot_003.png)

  Let your MY‚ÇøONK console boot from the USB stick.

  ![](img/NixOS_install_screenshots/NixOS_install_screenshot_010.png)

  After the welcome screen the first thing you are asked to configure is your Location, this is used to make sure the system is configured with the correct language and that the corresponding numbers and date formats are used, just choose the right one for you.

  ![](img/NixOS_install_screenshots/NixOS_install_screenshot_020.png)

  The next screen is the keyboard layout selection, which is invariably a point people struggle with depending on what country they are from (azerty, querty ...) and also the variants that exist. **Take your time** trying a few (don't forget to try the special characters '@', '*', '_', '-', '/', ';', ':' .etc... ) until you find the best match. In my case it's "French" variant "French (Macintoch)". Not choosing the correct layout will result in keys inversions which will lead to you not being able to log in your system because the password you think you tap in does not actually enter the correct characters.

  ![](img/NixOS_install_screenshots/NixOS_install_screenshot_030.png)

  Next you are going to create the users for the system. For now we create a user ```mybonk``` with password ```mybonk``` and we use the same password for the administrator account.

  ![](img/NixOS_install_screenshots/NixOS_install_screenshot_040.png)

  Next you are going to be asked what Desktop you want to have. We don't want a Desktop, select "No desktop"

  ![](img/NixOS_install_screenshots/NixOS_install_screenshot_050.png)

  Next confirm "Unfree software" (read the reason behind this mentionned on the screen)
![](img/NixOS_install_screenshots/NixOS_install_screenshot_060.png)


  Next we are going to configure the storage devices and partitions. MY‚ÇøONK console has 2 built-in storage devices:
  - ```/dev/sda``` M1 mSATA 128GB SSD used for *system*: This is where the system boots from, where the operating system (and various caches) lives and where the swap space is allocated.
  - ```/dev/sdb``` SATA 1TB SSD used for *states*: This is where the system settings, the bitcoin blockchain and installed software settings as well as user data is stored. The data on this drive *persisted*


![](img/NixOS_install_screenshots/NixOS_install_screenshot_062.png)

  As this is a fresh new install these drives should not contain any partitions. If there are any on either of the disks delete them by selecting "New Partition Table" (Creating a new partition table will delete all data on the disk).
  Make sure you select "Master Boot Record (MBR)" instead of GUID Partition Table (GPT) when creating new partition tables
  ![](img/NixOS_install_screenshots/NixOS_install_screenshot_065.png)


  Let's configure ```/dev/sda```:


  ![](img/NixOS_install_screenshots/NixOS_install_screenshot_070.png)

  Let's configure ```/dev/sdb```:


  ![](img/NixOS_install_screenshots/NixOS_install_screenshot_080.png)


  Now select "Next" to confirm the partitions that are going created (and possibly prior deleted).

  ![](img/NixOS_install_screenshots/NixOS_install_screenshot_090.png)


  The intallation takes less than one minute click on "Toggle Logs" at the bottom right of the splash screen it to see and understand how the OS is being pulled and installed.

  ![](img/NixOS_install_screenshots/NixOS_install_screenshot_100.png)

  "All Done". Do **NOT** Unplug the USB stick just yet.

  Select "Restart now" and click on "Done"

  ![](img/NixOS_install_screenshots/NixOS_install_screenshot_110.png)

  When MY‚ÇøONK console is rebooting remove the USB stick it will then boot on the MBR of /dev/sda. Your system is now running by itself let's continue its configuration.

  On the MY‚ÇøONK console (this is the last time we will be using it, going forward we are doing to connect to the MY‚ÇøONK console "headless" using remote ssh) login as user ```mybonk``` password ```mybonk```

  ````
  $ ls /etc/nixos
  configuration.nix  hardware-configuration.nix
  ````

  ```configuration.nix``` and ```hardware-configuration.nix``` are the files used to build the running NixOS.

  Look at ```configuration.nix```
  ````
  $ nano /etc/nixos/configuration.nix
  ````
  You can see that most of the options you have been walked through during the installation by the wizard have been transalted into entries in this file. All features and services of the system are configurable through similar simple, human-readable options in this file.

  See [Nix - A One Pager](https://github.com/tazjin/nix-1p) for a short guide to Nix, the language used in ```configuration.nix```. Use [nix repl](https://nixos.wiki/wiki/Nix_command/repl) to interactively explore the Nix language as well as configurations, options and packages in Nixpkgs.

  Now look at ````hardware-configuration.nix````.
  ````
  $ nano /etc/nixos/hardware-configuration.nix
  ````
  This file was generated by the system, you don't normally edit it, make changes to ```configuration.nix``` instead.

  Next thing we want is connect to MY‚ÇøONK console using ssh so we can access it remotly ("headless", that is without a screen nor a keyboard attached).

  However sshd is a service that is not running on MY‚ÇøONK console yet, it is not even installed . Let's do it.

  ````
  ls -la /etc/nixos/configuration.nix
  -rw-r--r-- 1 root root 3155 ene 16 15:12 /etc/nixos/configuration.nix

  ````
  As you can see ```configuration.nix``` is editable only by *root* so you'll use sudo:

  ````
  sudo nano /etc/nixos/configuration.nix
  ````

  '````services.openssh.enable = true;````' is commented-out. Uncomment it. Also add the extra parameter '````services.openssh.permitRootLogin = "yes";````' to allow user *root* to use ssh too.

  ````
  # Enable the OpenSSH daemon.
  services.openssh.enable = true;
  services.openssh.permitRootLogin = "yes";
  ````

  Which could also be written like this:
  ````
  # Enable the OpenSSH daemon.
  services.openssh = {
    enable = true;
    permitRootLogin = "yes";
  };
  ````

  Save the file and exit.

  [```nixos-rebuild```](https://nixos.wiki/wiki/Nixos-rebuild) is the NixOS command used to apply changes made to the system configuration and various other tasks related to managing the state of a NixOS system. For a full list of sub-commands and options, see the nixos-rebuild man page.
  ````
  $ man nixos-rebuild
  ````

  Build the configuration and activate it, but don't add it (just yet) to the bootloader menu. This is done using the ```test``` subcommand
  ````
  $ sudo nixos-rebuild test
  building Nix...
  building the system configuration...
  activating the configuration...
  setting up /etc...
  reloading user units for root...
  reloading user units for mybonk...
  setting up tmpfiles
  ````
  Check the system logs as the system is reconfiguring:
  ````
  [mybonk@nixos:/etc/nixos]$ sudo journalctl -f -n 60
  ````
  So `ctrl+C` to exit the logs. Entries refering to the system change and sshd being enabled are being displayed.

  Confirm it is running:
  ````
  $ systemctl status sshd.service
‚óè sshd.service - SSH Daemon
     Loaded: loaded (/etc/systemd/system/sshd.service; enabled; preset: enabled)
     Active: active (running) since Mon 2023-01-16 16:46:09 CST; 1h 42min ago

      Tasks: 1 (limit: 9326)
     Memory: 5.9M

     CGroup: /system.slice/sshd.service
             ‚îî‚îÄ850 "sshd: /nix/store/qy9jighrfllrfy8shipl3j41m9k336vv-openssh-9.1p1/bin/sshd -D -f /etc/ssh/sshd_config [listener] 0 of 10-100 startup>
  ````

  The ```switch``` subcommand will not only rebuild the system, it will also activate the new generation immediately and make it the new default option in the bootloader, making your system configuration changes persistant.
  ````
  $ sudo nixos-rebuild switch
  [sudo] password for mybonk:
  building Nix...
  building the system configuration...
  updating GRUB 2 menu...
  Warning: os-prober will be executed to detect other bootable partitions.
  Its output will be used to detect bootable binaries on them and create new boot entries.

  lsblk: /dev/mapper/disks*[0-9]: not a block device
  activating the configuration...
  setting up /etc...
  reloading user units for mybonk...
  setting up tmpfiles
  $
  ````

Your system changes are now persistant after reboot.

Now that sshd has been installed and is running let's ssh in. You need your MY‚ÇøONK console's IP address for this. The IP address has most likely been assigned by your internet router built-in DHCP server. Look for a new device and assigned IP address in your internet router pannel.

Alternatively you can get it from the command line using the command ```ifconfig```. In this instance, MY‚ÇøONK console wired network interface is ```enp2s0```.

  ````
  $ ifconfig
  enp2s0: flags=4163<UP,BROADCAST,RUNNING,MULTICAST>  mtu 1500
        inet 192.168.0.64  netmask 255.255.255.0  broadcast 192.168.0.255
        inet6 2a02:2788:a4:285:1e48:f4dc:5f3a:afaf  prefixlen 64  scopeid 0x0<global>

        TX errors 0  dropped 0 overruns 0  carrier 0  collisions 0
  ````

  You can see its IP address is ```192.168.0.64```.
  To avoid having to remember this IP address we can map it to a hostname on our machine, here '```mybonk_console```' (this is useful to access systems that do not have a DNS entry or if you want to overwrite them in a test or development environment).

  ````
$ echo "192.168.0.64 mybonk_console" | sudo tee -a /etc/hosts
  ````
  OK now you're ready, ssh into your MY‚ÇøONK console from your laptop:

````
$ ssh mybonk@mybonk_console
The authenticity of host 'mybonk_console (192.168.0.64)' can't be established.

You have learned:
- How to enable a service (````sshd````) and tune it through Nix configuration ('````services.openssh.enable = true;```` and '```services.openssh.permitRootLogin = "yes";```' in ```configuration.nix```).
- How to use ssh with and without password (using key pair).
- How to test these configuration changes (e.g. ```nixos-rebuild test```, ```systemctl status sshd```, ```journalctl -f -n 30 -u sshd``` ) before making them percistant across reboots (```nixos-rebuild switch```).

In a subsequent sections we will see how your MY‚ÇøONK orchestrator can remotly manage one (or multiple) MY‚ÇøONK console(s).


### 1.3 Download and install MYBONK

<a name="13-option-1"></a>
#### **Option 1.** The manual "way"

Exactly the same way we installed, configured and enabled the service openssh modifying only the nixos configuration file ```configuration.nix``` in the previous section, we can enable all sorts of services and parameters.

Let's install, configure and run the service ```bitcoind``` and see how it goes.
A package is readily available for ```bitcoind``` on https://mynixos.com/nixpkgs/package/bitcoind, look at its documentation.

ssh into MY‚ÇøONK console as '```mybonk```':
`````
$ssh mybonk@mybonk_console
Last login: Tue Jan 17 10:42:32 2023 from 192.168.0.7
[mybonk@mybonkgenesis:~]$
`````

We are going to create a new file ```node.nix``` in ```/etc/nixos``` to build a basic bitcoin node on it with just a few lines...
`````
sudo nano node.nix
`````
And put the following content in it.
````
{ config, lib, pkgs, ... }:

with lib;

let
  cfg = config.services;
  nbLib = config.nix-bitcoin.lib;
  operatorName = config.nix-bitcoin.operator.name;
in {
  imports = [
    ../modules.nix    
  ];

  config =  {

    services.bitcoind = {
      enable = true;
      listen = true;
      dbCache = 1000;
    };

  };
}

````

`sudo nano configuration.nix`

Now edit the main configuration file, ```configuration.nix``` to use ```node.nix``` in the ```imports```:
````
  imports =
    [
      ./hardware-configuration.nix
      ./node.nix
    ];

````

#### **Option 2.** The automated way using a MYBONK orchestrator
  Ref. section [Build your MY‚ÇøONK orchestrator](#build-orchestrator).

---

# 2. Build your MYBONK orchestrator
This machine is used to orchestrate your fleet of MY‚ÇøONK consoles. It does not have to run nixOS (only nix package manager).

You could use your day to day laptop, but some people reported issues or additional pitfalls e.g. on macOS (read-only filesystem / single-user/multi-user).
For everyone to use a similar enviroment we use a virtual machine on VirtualBox.

MY‚ÇøONK orchestrator is a barebone Debian living in a VirtualBox.


### 2.1. Download and install VirtualBox
Follow the instructions on their website https://www.virtualbox.org

### 2.2. Build the OS in VirtualBox
  Now that VirtualBox is installed you can have an OS run on it (Linux Debian in our case).

  There are 2 ways to do this:
  #### **Option 1.** Using the installation image from Debian
  - From https://www.debian.org/distrib/  
  - With this method you go through the standard steps of installing the Debian OS just as if you were installing it on a new desktop but doing it in a VirtualBox
  - Don't forget to take note of the the machine's IP address and login details you choose during the installation!
  - Detailed instructions: https://techcolleague.com/how-to-install-debian-on-virtualbox/
  #### **Option 2.** Using a ready-made Virtual Box VDI (Virtual Disk Image)
  - From https://www.linuxvmimages.com/images/debian-11/
  - Quicker and more convenient than Option 1 as this is a pre-installed Debian System.
  - The login details are typically on the download page (in our case ``debian``/```debian``` and can become ```root``` by using ```$ sudo su -``` ).
  - Do not use such images in a production environment.
  - It is common to have issues with keyboard layout when accessing a machine that has been configured in a different language (e.x. the first few letters of the keyboard write ```querty``` instead of ```azerty``` and other keys don't behave normally). There are various ways to adjust this in the configuration but it's out of the scope of this document. The simplest and most effective is to find a way to login using the erroneous keyboard layout anyhow figuring out which key is which then once in the Desktop Environment ajust the settings in "Region & Language" > "Input Source".







Now you need to install some additional pretty common software packages that will be needed to continue. Debian's package manager is [apt](https://www.cyberciti.biz/tips/linux-debian-package-management-cheat-sheet.html?utm_source=Linux_Unix_Command&utm_medium=faq&utm_campaign=nixcmd). Root privileges are required to mofify packages installed on the system which is why we prepend the following commands with [sudo](https://www.cyberciti.biz/tips/linux-debian-package-management-cheat-sheet.html?utm_source=Linux_Unix_Command&utm_medium=faq&utm_campaign=nixcmd).

Update the packages index:

```
$ sudo apt update command
```

Install the additional packages (Debian 11 Bullseye) [curl](https://manpages.org/curl), [git](https://manpages.org/git), ***[gnupg2](), [dirmngr]()***:
```
$ sudo apt install curl git
```

### 2.3. ssh and auto login
First of all you need the IP address of the machine you want to connect to, the MY‚ÇøONK orchestrator's. As it runs in a Virtual Box you need to make sure the network setting of its virtual machine is set to "*bridge adapter*" for it to be assigned an IP. If unsure have a look at [ssh into a VirtualBox](https://www.golinuxcloud.com/ssh-into-virtualbox-vm/#Method-1_SSH_into_VirtualBox_using_Bridged_Network_Adapter).

Also note that in Debian ssh restrictions apply to ```root``` user:

In the ssh server configuration '```/etc/ssh/sshd_config```'

Open ```/etc/ssh/sshd_config``` using ```nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config``` and see the setting ```PermitRootLogin``` is indeed ```prohibit-password```.

Other possible values are ```without-password``` and ```yes```. ```prohibit-password``` and ```without-password``` now ban all interactive authentication methods, allowing only public-key, hostbased and GSSAPI authentication (previously it permitted keyboard-interactive and password-less authentication if those were enabled).

It is generaly advised to avoid using user ```root``` especially to remote-access. You can use ```sudo -i``` from another user instead when needed.

Leave the setting ```PermitRootLogin``` as ```prohibit-password```.


### 2.4. Install Nix


  #### **Option 1.** Using the ready-made binary distribution from nix cache
  - Quicker and more convenient than Option 2 as it has been pre-built for you.

    ssh into the orchestrator and run:
    ```
    $ sh <(curl -L https://nixos.org/nix/install)   
    ```

  You can see outputs related to Nix binary being downloaded and installed.

  ```      
  Installation finished!  To ensure that the necessary environment variables are set, either log in again, or type

  . ~/.nix-profile/etc/profile.d/nix.sh

  in your shell.
  ```
  And as instructed run the following command (or logout or login again):

  ```
  . ~/.nix-profile/etc/profile.d/nix.sh
  ```

  Check the installation went OK

  ```
  $ nix --version
  nix (Nix) 2.12.0
  ```

  Have a first look at the manual
  ```
  $ man nix
  ```


  #### **Option 2.** Building Nix from the source
  - Regarded as the "sovereign" way to do it but takes more time.
  - Follow the instructions on nix page https://nixos.org/nix/manual/#ch-installing-source


### 2.4. Build MYBONK stack
Now that the MY‚ÇøONK orchestrator is up and running we can use it to build MY‚ÇøONK stack and deploy it seemlesly to the fleet of MY‚ÇøONK consoles in a secure, controlled and effortless way.

[MY‚ÇøONK stack](/docs/MYBONK_stack.md) is derived from [nix-bitcoin](https://github.com/fort-nix/nix-bitcoin/). Have a look at their GitHub, especially their [examples](https://github.com/fort-nix/nix-bitcoin/blob/master/examples/README.md) section.

Login to your MY‚ÇøONK orchestrator:

```
ssh debian@mybonk_orchestrator
$
```

This MY‚ÇøONK orchestrator machine needs root passwordless key pair ssh access to the target MY‚ÇøONK console. Generate our key pair and eneable ssh auto login for user ```mybonk``` (password '```mybonk```') on the relote MY‚ÇøONK console (192.168.0.64) as explained in section '[0. ssh and auto-login](#0-ssh-and-auto-login)'.

And add a shortcut for it at the end of your ssh config file (```~/.ssh/config```):


```
Host mybonk-console-root
    Hostname 192.168.0.64
    User root
    PubkeyAuthentication yes
    IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_rsa
    AddKeysToAgent yes

Host mybonk-console-mybonk
    Hostname 192.168.0.64
    User mybonk
    PubkeyAuthentication yes
    IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_rsa
    AddKeysToAgent yes

```

Now, log-in as ```mybonk```.

```
$ ssh mybonk-console-mybonk
```

Clone nix-bitcoin in your home directory:

```
git clone https://github.com/fort-nix/nix-bitcoin
```

This creates a directory ```nix-bitcoin```, have a look inside:

```
cd nix-bitcoin
ls -la

It contains the basic configuration on top of which we are going to overlay MY‚ÇøONK specificities and features. Don't worry too much trying to figure out what each of these files and directories do, we are not going to modify anything in itthese, only reuse (copy/past) some of its content.


Get into the ```example``` directory and run the command ```nix-shell```. [nix-shell](https://nixos.org/manual/nix/stable/command-ref/nix-shell.html) interprets ```shell.nix``` and pulls all the dependancies it refers to, it will that a few minutes to execute:
```
cd examples
nix-shell
```
The output of the command tells us that 117 paths will be fetched (126.56 MiB download, 756.95 MiB unpacked)

Go back to your home directory and create a new directory ```mybonk```

```
cd
mkdir mybonk
cd mybonk
```

Copy the initial files and directory ```nix-bitcoin-release.nix```, ```configuration.nix```, ```shell.nix```, ```krops``` and ```.gitignore``` from ```nix-bitcoin/examples```.

````
cp -r ../nix-bitcoin/examples/{nix-bitcoin-release.nix,configuration.nix,shell.nix,krops,.gitignore} .

### 2.5. Deploy MYBONK stack to the MYBONK consoles

There are dozens of options available to deploy a nixOS configuration: NixOps, krops, morph, NixUS, deploy-rs, Bento .etc.. , each with their pros and cons.
[NixOps](https://github.com/NixOS/nixops/blob/master/README.md), the official DevOps tool of NixOS is nice but it has some flaws. [krops](https://github.com/krebs/krops/blob/master/README.md) solves some of these flaws with very simple concepts, some of its features are:
- store your secrets in password store
- build your systems remotely
- minimal overhead (it's basically just nixos-rebuild switch!)
- run from custom nixpkgs branch/checkout/fork

We are going to use krops too as it is already used by nix-bitcoin.

Read [this very well written article](https://tech.ingolf-wagner.de/nixos/krops/) to get an idea of how krops works before you get started.

First, krops needs to ssh MY‚ÇøONK console using automatic login with keys pair. We have done this earlier let's move on ...

On your orchestrator machine make sure you are in the (```mybonk```) deployment directory, edit ```krops/deploy.nix```` which is the main deployment configuration file:

Locate the FIXME and set the target to the name of the ssh config entry created earlier, i.e. mybonk-node.

```

```
